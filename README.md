# Pi Day Toolkit Template
This contains a LaTeX file that is a companion to my MAA FOCUS Toolkit column article about a Pi Day activity.

Feel free to download and use the file "PiDayTemplate.tex". In the top 7 lines, you will find three options to change:
1) "backgroundcolor" changes the color of the background in the grid;
2) "dotcolor" changes the color of the small dots that have been placed as a guide for gluing the pom-poms.
3) "dotsize" changes how big to plot the guide dots (making this "0pt" will remove the dots altogether for more of a challenge).
